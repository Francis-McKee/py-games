# py-games

This GitHub repo includes the different games from the book ["Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python" by Al Sweigart](https://nostarch.com/inventwithpython#diff).
This is not my code, thus I do not own the rights to it. Just typed out the code and made some changes to learn a bit of Python. All credit goes to Al Sweigart.
